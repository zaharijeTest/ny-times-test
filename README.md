# ny-times-test
Simple NY Times API react-native application. 

Application demonstrates integration with NY Times API built upon Expo react-native container. Expo provides simple way to wrap react native application with browser debugining.

To install run:
`npm install`
and
`npm start`.
This will open browser tab in which You can scan the code to run on Your mobile device.

To debug in browser when application starts press `w` in Your terminal when application finishes building.

To run tests, run `npm test`. Tests are not completed at this stage, but should implement NY Times API test (providing valid and invalid API key and checking if service is offline).
